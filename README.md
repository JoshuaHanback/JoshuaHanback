- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoshuaHanback
- 👀 I’m interested in woodworking and cycling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become an electrical engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I work alone, few exceptions.
- 📫 How to reach me you can't, unless you try really hard, I avoid going on the line as much as possible.
